# corey-ellis-portfolio

This is my portfolio website. Created in Node and Express.js, the front-end for this website is based on a theme from https://startbootstrap.com/ called 'Freelancer'. 

This website contains an introduction to my main projects, which you'll also find on my GitHub page.

This website is currently hosted on Heroku at https://www.coreyellis.dev/
